1. Unzip to a new folder.
2. From the terminal of that folder run: make
3. For running all tests: ./test.out
4. For running specific test: ./test.out <test index>
5. The results will be displayed on the terminal.
6. In case of failure you'll be able to see the exact line caused the failure.

Good luck:)

Note: test no. 9 takes a few seconds (~3).
